<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Inspired by the discussions at the Blockchain Campus Conference held at MapÃºa University Makati by The BLOKC on November 25, 2023, the FWDP community has decided to create an open-source learning platform on GitHub for aspiring blockchain engineers.

Assuming that the person has knowledge and experience in frontend and backend web development, below is a **focused curriculum** to become a **junior blockchain developer**, as suggested by Bing AI.

1. **Blockchain Fundamentals**:
    - **Understand the Basics**:
        - Learn about **blockchain technology**, its underlying principles, and how it works.
        - Explore **decentralization**, **consensus algorithms**, and **distributed ledger systems**.
        - Dive into **cryptography** and its role in securing blockchain networks.
    - **Projects**:
        - Create a simple **private blockchain** using a language like **JavaScript** or **Python**.

2. **Smart Contracts and Ethereum**:
    - **Solidity Programming**:
        - Master **Solidity**, the primary language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
        - Understand **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and how smart contracts are executed.
    - **Token Creation**:
        - Build your own **ERC-20 token** (a standard for fungible tokens) or explore other token standards.
    - **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**:
        - Develop a basic **DApp** using **Truffle** or **Hardhat** frameworks.
    - **Projects**:
        - Create a **crowdfunding DApp** where users can contribute and receive tokens.

3. **Blockchain Architecture**:
    - **Consensus Mechanisms**:
        - Study different consensus algorithms like **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
    - **Network Nodes and Validation**:
        - Set up your own **blockchain node** and participate in network validation.
    - **Projects**:
        - Design a **private PoA (Proof of Authority)** blockchain network.

4. **Advanced Topics** (Optional):
    - **Oracles and Interoperability**:
        - Explore how blockchain interacts with external data sources using **oracles**.
        - Learn about **cross-chain interoperability**.
    - **Privacy and Security**:
        - Investigate privacy solutions like **zk-SNARKs** and **ring signatures**.
        - Understand **security best practices** for smart contracts.
    - **Projects**:
        - Build a **decentralized prediction market** or an **identity management system**.

5. **Capstone Project**:
    - Combine your knowledge from the previous topics to create a comprehensive project.
    - Examples: **NFT marketplace**, **supply chain tracking**, or a **decentralized voting system**.

## Contributing
Contributions are the lifeblood of our open source community, transforming it into a dynamic space for knowledge exchange, inspiration, and innovation. Your involvement is not just welcomed but enthusiastically embraced. 

Feel free to suggest enhancements by doing the following!

1. Fork the repository:
    - Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This can be done by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.
2. Clone your forked repository:
    - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    ```
3. Make changes and commit:
    - Make the necessary changes to the codebase.
    - Add and commit your changes using the following commands: 
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
    ```
    - Ensure that your commit message follows the [standards](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-commit-message#using-imperative-verb-form) by using imperative verb form (not past tense).
4. Push changes to your repository:
    - Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub: 
    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```
5. Create a pull request:
    - Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
    - Set the base repository's branch to the original repository's main branch.
    - Set the head repository's branch to your forked repository's main branch.
    - Create the pull request.
6. Code Review and Merge:
    - Await feedback and review comments from project maintainers.
    - Make any necessary adjustments based on the feedback.
    - Once approved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main repository.
