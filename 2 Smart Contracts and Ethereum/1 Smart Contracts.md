# Smart Contracts
## What is a smart contract?

A smart contract blockchain is an automated program that encapsulates a contract with its terms. It offers developers a method to decentralize the code execution. Typically deployed on blockchain networks, the code becomes publicly available, allowing other nodes to enforce the logic. This transparency and openness enable anyone to inspect the smart contract's code, fostering trust in its execution.
